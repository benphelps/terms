      window.__TERM_DATA__ = {"term":"Lush","sentiment":0.9,"primaryCategory":"positive","subCategories":["Tonal Balance","Presentation"],"summary":"Lush sound is rich, full-bodied, and luxurious, often with a sweet and smooth midrange. It gives music a euphonic, flowing quality.","shortExplanation":"When audiophiles describe a headphone or amp as lush, they mean it produces a very satisfying, creamy sound, especially in the midrange (where voices and many instruments lie). A lush sound usually has plenty of mid-bass and mids, and possibly even-order harmonic distortion (like what tube amplifiers add) that creates a \"thick\" and musical timbre. The result is that music can feel romantic or organic – notes have a bit of weight and bloom to them. It's not about hyper-detail; it's about tone. A lush presentation can make vocals sound more emotive and strings more silky. However, if something is overly lush, it might be at the cost of speed or clarity – the extreme would be sounding overly thick or sluggish. But generally, lush is used positively to indicate a beautiful, immersive smoothness in sound that draws you in.","detailedDescription":"The term <i>lush</i> is often associated with gear that adds a bit of coloration that our ears find pleasurable. For instance, vacuum tube amplifiers often impart a lush quality: they introduce strong even-order harmonics (which are musically consonant) and often a bit of warmth. Headphonesty’s glossary notes lush sound often comes from even harmonics and is <i>“pleasing and warm sounding”</i>, typically with strong bass in the 100–300 Hz range. In other words, the lower mids and upper bass are elevated enough to give body to the music. This, combined with smooth highs, yields a <i>lush tonality</i>.<br><br>In a lush sound, you might notice that male and female vocals have a kind of golden richness, pianos sound full-bodied, and even normally thin instruments gain a bit of weight. It can also be described as <b>“liquid”</b> or <b>“fluid”</b> – the opposite of dry or analytical. <i>Lush</i> often comes up in discussions of headphones like certain ZMF models or classic Sennheisers with tube amps, which are beloved for their midrange lushness.<br><br>Listeners who prioritize <i>musicality and emotion</i> often seek a lush sound because it can make listening very enjoyable and fatigue-free. Jazz, vocal, acoustic, and classical lovers might enjoy lush presentations that make timbres beautiful and engaging. On the contrary, someone who wants utmost precision might find a lush sound <i>too colored</i> or <i>too thick</i>. There is sometimes a trade-off: the same quality that makes the sound lush (enhanced harmonics and bass bloom) can reduce the perception of separation and speed. The music may not hit as hard or as sharply – it <i>flows</i> instead. For many, that’s a worthwhile and even addictive trait.<br><br>In community terms, <i>lush</i> is nearly always a compliment. It’s saying the sound is <i>gorgeous</i> in some way. Newcomers should not confuse it with <i>muddy</i> or <i>boomy</i>; a well-done lush sound is warm and rich but still <i>clear enough</i>. Misuse of the term could happen if someone thinks lush just means lots of bass – it’s more about mids and harmonics.<br><br>There’s a bit of overlap with <i>warm</i> and <i>smooth</i> when describing lush. Lush usually implies both of those (warmth in the bass/mids and smoothness in treble) plus a kind of <i>romantic, euphonic bloom</i>. If a sound is warm but still kind of flat in presentation, you might not call it lush. Lush tends to mean it’s warm + enveloping + emotionally resonant.<br><br><b>Some debates:</b> Is lush sound “high fidelity”? Objectivists might say adding coloration (like tube warmth) is distortion, so it’s not true to the recording. Subjectivists respond that if it sounds more enjoyable and still close enough, why not – it’s <i>euphonic</i>. This boils down to preference. Lush gear often isn’t the most strictly accurate, but it can be what people love listening to the most.<br><br>In summary, describing audio as <i>lush</i> paints a picture of sonic luxury – rich tones, full textures, and a smooth, sweet delivery. It’s the chocolate fudge of sound signatures: maybe a bit rich for some, but oh-so-enjoyable for others. If you see a reviewer use “lush” about mids or vocals, expect a sound that will likely be very pleasing and captivating in a soulful way.","relatedTerms":["Warm","Musical","Rich","Euphonic"],"oppositeTerms":["Dry","Analytical","Thin","Clinical"],"tags":["rich","full","creamy","organic"],"technicalRange":"100-300Hz boost"};
