      window.__TERM_DATA__ = {"term":"Airy","sentiment":0.8,"primaryCategory":"positive","subCategories":["Treble Character","Spatial","Detail & Texture"],"summary":"An airy sound has a sense of openness and delicate high-frequency extension, giving music a light, spacious quality.","shortExplanation":"Audio described as <i>airy</i> conveys subtle high-end details and \"space\" around instruments – almost as if the sound has a gentle breeze or open atmosphere to it. This usually comes from excellent treble extension into the highest frequencies (well beyond 10 kHz), allowing the listener to perceive the faint trails of reverb and the natural decay of notes, which adds a feeling of width and openness instead of a closed-in or heavy presentation.","detailedDescription":"<i>Airiness</i> is a prized quality for many audiophiles because it makes the music feel less confined. Headphones or IEMs with an airy sound signature often have a smooth, extended treble that avoids abrupt roll-off.<br><br>This means you can hear the fine <i>\"air\" or ambience</i> in recordings – for example, the slight echo of a room or the breath in a singer's voice – contributing to a spacious and delicate presentation. An airy headphone can give the impression of a larger soundstage because the treble doesn't feel trapped or muffled.<br><br>By contrast, gear that lacks air might sound <b>closed-off or dull</b>, as if the upper treble details are missing. Airiness is usually mentioned positively, often in open-back headphones or well-tuned earbuds where the highs are <i>ethereal and expansive</i>.<br><br>However, too much emphasis on the highest frequencies can make a headphone <i>sound thin</i> or introduce hiss, so balance is key. When present in the right amount, <i>air</i> adds a pleasing transparency and realism to music, making it sound more lifelike and less congested.","relatedTerms":["Detailed","Smooth","Bright","Spacious"],"oppositeTerms":["Veiled","Dark","Closed-in"],"tags":["openness","high-frequency","spacious","ethereal"],"technicalRange":"10kHz+"};
