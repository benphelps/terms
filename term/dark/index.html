      window.__TERM_DATA__ = {"term":"Dark","sentiment":-0.2,"primaryCategory":"neutral","subCategories":["Treble Character","Tonal Balance"],"summary":"Dark sound means the treble is subdued or attenuated, often paired with stronger bass/lower mids – this makes the overall tone more mellow and less detailed in the highs.","shortExplanation":"A <i>dark</i> headphone is essentially the opposite of a bright one. It has an under-emphasis on the upper midrange and treble, which yields a tonal balance tilted toward the low end.<br><br>In practical terms, dark-sounding gear will make things like cymbals, violins, and vocal \"air\" sound softer or more distant. The upside is that dark signatures tend to be <i>smooth and non-fatiguing</i> – you're less likely to get harshness or sibilance.<br><br>The downside is that they <b>lack some clarity or \"shine\"</b> on the high notes, meaning fine details or a sense of openness might be diminished. A mildly dark tuning can be very pleasant for easy listening, but if it's too dark, music can come across as veiled or overly mellow.","detailedDescription":"The term <i>dark</i> often implies both a treble roll-off and sometimes a mid-bass elevation (though not always – one could have a flat bass and just recessed treble and still call it dark).<br><br>The effect is that the sound has a <b>warm, thick, or heavy</b> character with muted top-end details. Imagine listening to music in a room with the treble tone control turned down – the general feeling is relaxed, but you lose some definition.<br><br>Some classic headphones (like certain Sennheiser models or vintage tunes) are known for a dark signature, providing a fatigue-free experience that some love, especially for long sessions or treble-sensitive ears. When details in the music seem hidden or the sound lacks \"air,\" reviewers might use <i>dark</i> in a critical sense, noting that the headphone doesn't reveal as much high-frequency information.<br><br>It's important to differentiate <i>dark</i> from <i>warm</i>. Warm typically refers to boosted bass/mids (with possibly slightly reduced treble), giving a rich sound, whereas <i>dark</i> usually emphasizes that the treble is <b>pulled back significantly</b>, possibly even more so than a typical warm tuning, such that the fine details are noticeably soft.<br><br>In fact, if a headphone has <i>too much warmth (bass/mid-bass)</i> <b>and</b> <i>too little treble</i>, it might cross from \"warm and smooth\" into \"dark and veiled\" because the overemphasis on lower frequencies and lack of highs makes the sound less clear overall.<br><br>Many listeners actually enjoy a mildly dark sound because it's easy on the ears. For example, if you find bright headphones irritating, a dark-tilting set can allow you to listen longer without fatigue. Dark headphones often pair well with bright or modern recordings, taming their sharp edges.<br><br>On the other hand, if a recording is already on the warm/dark side, a dark headphone can make it <i>too</i> dull. Thus, synergy plays a role. Some enthusiasts might mod or EQ a dark headphone to extract a bit more treble, referring to lifting a \"veil\".<br><br>A common misconception is that <i>dark</i> always equals <i>bad</i>. That's not true – it's a flavor. There are high-end headphones known for a darkish tuning that many adore for their relaxing sound. The key is that while they might not be the last word in treble detail, they compensate with a very <i>natural, fatigue-free midrange</i> and bass.<br><br>In sum, describing sound as <i>dark</i> points to treble deficiency and a warmer tilt, yielding a smoother but less detailed presentation. It's great for some uses and people, but those who crave sparkling highs and micro-details might find dark gear underwhelming.","relatedTerms":["Warm","Smooth","Laid-back"],"oppositeTerms":["Bright","Airy","Sparkly"],"tags":["treble-recessed","mellow","subdued","thick"],"technicalRange":"Reduced 4kHz+"};
