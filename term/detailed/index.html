      window.__TERM_DATA__ = {"term":"Detailed","sentiment":0.9,"primaryCategory":"positive","subCategories":["Detail & Texture","Presentation"],"summary":"Detailed sound is one that reveals tiny nuances and fine information in the music clearly – you can easily hear subtle elements that might be missed on less resolving equipment.","shortExplanation":"When a headphone or IEM is described as <b>detailed</b>, it means it has excellent resolution. You'll notice things like slight finger movements on guitar strings, the texture of a bow on a violin, the breath of a singer between words, or faint background instruments, all presented distinctly rather than smeared together.<br><br>This comes from a combination of a well-extended, clear treble and fast driver response that brings out micro-detail. Detailed headphones often give the impression of <i>high clarity and focus</i>, making complex music more transparent.<br><br>However, sometimes a very detailed sound can also expose flaws in recordings (tape hiss, editing cuts) or become fatiguing if the detail is achieved by an overly bright tuning.","detailedDescription":"<i>Detail retrieval</i> (often just called resolution) is a hallmark of high-end audio. Audiophiles pursue gear that can <i>'lift the veil'</i> off recordings and unearth information that lesser gear blurs.<br><br>A headphone known for detail will make each instrument in a busy mix easier to follow, because it minimizes masking and distortion. Technically, detail can be related to factors like a flat frequency response through the mids/treble (so nothing important is recessed) and low distortion (so subtle cues aren't lost in noise). <b>Fast transient response</b> also plays a role: a driver that can start and stop quickly can articulate each note without smearing into the next, preserving detail.<br><br>Describing something as <i>detailed</i> is almost always praise. Words like <b>\"resolving,\" \"high-resolution,\" \"revealing,\" \"accurate,\" or \"transparent\"</b> often accompany this descriptor. For instance, a reviewer might say <i>\"these IEMs are extremely resolving – I could hear the singer's inhale and the slight quiver in their voice, details I never noticed before.\"</i> This is the kind of performance detail lovers seek.<br><br>On the flip side, detail can be a double-edged sword if taken too far. Some headphones artificially <b>emphasize treble</b> to <i>seem</i> more detailed (because our ears are very sensitive to subtle high-frequency info), but that can introduce harshness. So, the best detailed headphones manage to deliver loads of information <i>without sounding etched or piercing</i>.<br><br>This is why planar magnetic or electrostatic headphones, known for combining quick transients and relatively smooth treble, are often lauded as extremely detailed yet refined.<br><br><b>Debates:</b> One debate is <i>\"true detail vs. fake detail.\"</i> True detail means the gear genuinely has better resolving power (e.g., lower distortion, better transient response). \"Fake detail\" implies the gear is just brighter – giving an illusion of more detail by highlighting the high frequencies.<br><br>Experienced listeners often try to discern this: a headphone that is <b>bright but coarse</b> might reveal some things yet mask others, whereas a headphone that's detailed due to quality drivers will reveal everything <i>across the spectrum</i> (you hear low-level bass texture as well as treble nuances).<br><br>Another aspect is that extremely detailed sound isn't always <i>musical</i>. Some find that when they focus on every tiny sound, they lose the emotional forest for the trees. Others live for the analytical thrill of dissecting music.<br><br>In summary, calling a headphone <i>detailed</i> or <i>resolving</i> is highlighting one of its strengths – it paints the music in high definition. It's a trait often associated with top-tier and reference headphones. Just remember that detail should ideally come alongside a balanced tonality; the best gear is both detailed <b>and</b> natural, whereas some gear achieve detail at the expense of comfort.<br><br>If you're a newcomer, hearing a truly detailed headphone for the first time can be a revelatory experience, showing you new layers in your favorite songs.","relatedTerms":["Resolving","Transparent","Revealing","Analytical"],"oppositeTerms":["Veiled","Muddy","Blurry"],"tags":["resolution","clarity","micro-detail","transparent"],"technicalRange":"Full spectrum"};
