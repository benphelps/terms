This typically happens if the headphone has a peak in the upper treble (commonly around 6–10 kHz) where these sibilant frequencies lie. For example, the \"ess\" in \"miss\" might sound like a mini steam leak. Sibilance is almost always unwanted – it's a sign that the treble is not well controlled. Some recordings themselves have sibilance, but a forgiving headphone will damp that, whereas a sibilant-prone headphone will make it worse. Audiophiles often test for sibilance with specific tracks (e.g., female vocals known to be on edge) to see if a headphone handles them smoothly or accentuates the issue.","detailedDescription":"<i>Sibilant</i> sound has an exaggerated, harsh emphasis on “s” and “sh” sounds in vocals (and similar high-frequency noises like cymbal hiss), making those specific sounds come across as sharp, hissing, or piercing.<br><br>Sibilance is something you’ll notice particularly on vocals: when a singer hits an “S” or “T” consonant, a sibilant headphone will make it sound overly bright or even <i>cringe-inducing</i>, like a sudden hiss or “spike” of sound. This typically happens if the headphone has a peak in the upper treble (commonly around 6–10 kHz) where these sibilant frequencies lie. For example, the “ess” in “miss” might sound like a mini steam leak. Sibilance is almost always unwanted – it’s a sign that the treble is not well controlled. Some recordings themselves have sibilance, but a forgiving headphone will damp that, whereas a sibilant-prone headphone will make it worse. Audiophiles often test for sibilance with specific tracks (e.g., female vocals known to be on edge) to see if a headphone handles them smoothly or accentuates the issue.<br><br><b>Detailed Description:</b> <i>Sibilance</i> comes from the Latin <i>sibilare</i>, to hiss – quite fitting. It’s a very specific kind of harshness narrowly focused on sibilant consonants. Many people are particularly sensitive to this because it directly affects vocals, and nothing pulls you out of enjoying a song like winching at every “s” the singer utters.<br><br>In technical terms, sibilance typically occurs in the <b>upper-treble region (around 4 kHz to 8 kHz)</b> which is where the energy of “S” sounds resides. A headphone with a peak in that zone will exaggerate sibilant content. If a headphone is described as sibilant, the reviewer has clearly noticed it making vocals or cymbals unpleasant in that manner. It could be mild or severe; sometimes people say “it’s borderline sibilant on some tracks” meaning just a bit hot on S sounds, versus “it’s a sibilance nightmare” meaning it makes many vocals piercing.<br><br>It’s worth noting that <i>not all bright headphones are sibilant.</i> A headphone can have lots of treble but, if tuned carefully, not spike exactly in those sibilance frequencies or could have a controlled, smooth treble rise. Sibilance often is a result of a narrow spike or resonance. Some IEMs, for example, have resonance peaks that cause sibilance even if the rest of the treble is okay. The <i>ear gain</i> region (around 3 kHz) plus poorly damped peaks in 5–7 kHz can be to blame.<br><br>When evaluating gear, people often mention sibilance if present because it’s a deal-breaker for many. It’s unpleasant and fatiguing. A headphone that is otherwise great but sibilant on vocals will see that flaw pointed out frequently. On the other hand, a headphone that <i>avoids</i> sibilance gets praise for being <i>smooth</i> or <i>forgiving</i>.<br><br><b>Misconceptions:</b> Sometimes a newbie might think any bright sound is sibilant, but sibilance specifically refers to those S and T sounds. If a headphone is bright but not making S’s hissy, it might not be sibilant per se. Also, the source matters: some recordings have sibilance inherently (due to microphone or production). A truly neutral headphone might reveal that sibilance (so you might think the headphone is sibilant, but it’s actually the track). However, generally when we call a headphone sibilant, we mean it’s exacerbating or introducing more sibilance than is natural.<br><br><b>Cures:</b> Using EQ to notch down the offending frequency can mitigate sibilance. Certain pads or filters can also tame a sibilant headphone. There are even “de-esser” plugins in studio work to reduce sibilance in recordings. In headphone design, damping materials are often used to smooth out treble peaks that cause sibilance.<br><br>Community example: The infamous Shure SE535 IEM (for some) had a reputation of sibilance for certain people, or the Beyerdynamic DT990 (bright peaks that could be sibilant). In contrast, something like the HD650 is often praised for <i>non-sibilant</i> smooth treble even on hot tracks.<br><br>In summary, calling a headphone <i>sibilant</i> is a warning that high-frequency consonants are harsh. If you see that and you’re sensitive to sharp treble, that product likely isn’t for you (unless you plan to EQ or mod it). Conversely, if multiple reviewers say “no sibilance at all, even on sibilant tracks – very smooth treble,” that’s a good sign for an easy listen. Sibilance is one of those flaws that’s pretty obvious once you know what to listen for – and once you hear it, you can’t un-hear it. Thus, manufacturers try to tune it out, but not all succeed if they’re chasing extreme detail. The best gear gives you the detail <i>without</i> crossing into sibilant territory.","relatedTerms":["Harsh","Sharp","Piercing","Hissy"],"oppositeTerms":["Smooth","Non-sibilant","Forgiving"],"tags":["hissing","sharp","s-sounds","piercing"],"technicalRange":"6-10kHz peak"};
