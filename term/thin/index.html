      window.__TERM_DATA__ = {"term":"Thin","sentiment":-0.6,"primaryCategory":"negative","subCategories":["Tonal Balance","Bass Character"],"summary":"Thin sound means the audio lacks body and warmth – it comes across as light, sometimes brittle or hollow, especially in the bass and lower mids.","shortExplanation":"When someone calls a headphone's sound thin, they usually mean there isn't enough low-end weight or midrange richness to give instruments and voices a sense of heft. For example, male vocals might sound a bit anemic or weak, and bass notes might be present but lacking impact or depth. This often results from a recessed bass/lower midrange (or an overall bass-shy tuning). The opposite of thin would be full-bodied or rich – where notes have density and warmth. Thin sound can make music feel less engaging and too skewed toward the treble or upper mids. It can also be described as lean or clinical in some cases. While a thin signature can sometimes highlight detail (no bass to mask things), it often isn't satisfying for many listeners because the music loses some foundational weight.","detailedDescription":"<i>Thin</i> sound means the audio lacks body and warmth – it comes across as light, sometimes brittle or hollow, especially in the bass and lower mids. A thin-sounding headphone might have clear highs but will feel deficient in fullness, making vocals and instruments sound more fragile or less robust than they should.<br><br>Thinness in sound is akin to an image that’s been de-saturated of color – you get the outline, but not the fill. Technically, a thin sound is usually one where frequencies below ~200 Hz are de-emphasized. This means the bass lacks volume, and the lower mids (which give body to voices, cello, tom drums, etc.) are weak. Such a tuning can result in a sound that’s all crispy treble and clear upper mids but without the “meat” in the lower tones.<br><br><b>Common causes:</b> Some neutral or bright-tilted headphones can sound thin if they err on the side of being too flat in bass or even rolled-off in bass. Also, some open-back headphones without seal can struggle to convey sub-bass, making them seem thin compared to closed options. If someone is used to a bassy headphone and moves to a flatter one, they may initially perceive it as thin. Also, cheap earbuds or on-ears that have no low-end extension often are described as thin/tinny.<br><br><b>Descriptors and Synonyms:</b> <i>Lean</i> is often used interchangeably with thin (lean bass meaning not enough fatness). <i>Tinny</i> usually implies thin with a bit of a metallic quality (like the sound from a tiny radio). <i>Hollow</i> suggests a scoop in mids – voices sound hollow when lower harmonics are missing. All these paint a similar picture: insufficient lower-frequency energy.<br><br>Headphones that are thin might also be described as <i>analytical</i> or <i>dry</i> if that’s the intended effect – for instance, some studio headphones sacrifice bass quantity for accuracy, which can come off as thin but precise. Whether that’s good or bad depends on usage. For pure listening pleasure, most people like at least some warmth; too thin and music can feel emotionally lacking or “all bones, no flesh.”<br><br>AudioAdvisor’s glossary says <i>Thin: Lacks fullness and may sound shallow. Synonyms: tinny, hollow. Antonym: rich.</i> That encapsulates it well.<br><br>A thin headphone, when listening to orchestral, might make cellos and basses almost disappear behind violins. In rock, guitars might sound snappy but not chunky, and drums might lack oomph. Pop and electronic might feel like it’s missing the bass line’s groove. For voice-centric content like podcasts, thinness can make voices sound less natural (real human voices have chest resonance which is around 100-300 Hz). So thin reproduction can make a person’s voice sound like it’s coming through a phone (limited bandwidth), which is less pleasant.<br><br>Some genres or use-cases could benefit from a slightly lean sound – maybe if you truly want no bass interference (like mastering a track and you have a separate sub-check system). But generally, for enjoyment, a <i>thin</i> sound is not often praised. Usually if a reviewer says “the sound is a bit thin” it’s a mild critique suggesting they’d prefer more low-end to balance it out.<br><br><b>Opposites:</b> <i>Full, Full-bodied, Rich, Warm, Meaty</i> etc. A <i>thin</i> sound is the opposite of a <i>full-bodied</i> sound where, for instance, a piano’s lower notes have satisfying resonance and weight.<br><br><b>Related to Volume and Power:</b> Sometimes thinness can also result if a headphone is underpowered (not getting enough current/voltage from the amp). Planar magnetics, for example, might sound weak in bass (thin) if not properly driven. Once amped well, they might fill out. So if you encounter thin sound, it’s worth ensuring it’s not a power issue or source issue (some sources have high output impedance which can thin out bass on certain headphones due to damping factor mismatch, etc.).<br><br>In summary, <i>thin</i> is generally a warning sign that the sound may lack bass or warmth. If you love clarity and don’t mind missing some low-end, you might not object to thinness; but if you like your music with a sense of richness and foundation, a thin headphone will likely disappoint. It’s one of those terms that directly correlates with tonal preference – everyone has a tolerance for how lean is too lean. The goal for many is neutrality (which includes enough bass to not be thin). Thus, truly thin tunings are often niche or considered flawed for general enjoyment. Newcomers switching from consumer bassy headphones to reference ones might note thinness until they adjust or pair with a slight bass EQ to taste.","relatedTerms":["Lean","Anemic","Light","Hollow"],"oppositeTerms":["Full-bodied","Rich","Warm","Thick"],"tags":["lean","lacking-bass","hollow","light"],"technicalRange":"<200Hz deficient"};
