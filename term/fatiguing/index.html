      window.__TERM_DATA__ = {"term":"Fatiguing","sentiment":-0.8,"primaryCategory":"negative","subCategories":["Presentation","Treble Character"],"summary":"Fatiguing sound is audio that causes listener fatigue over time – it might be exciting or loud initially, but it quickly tires your ears or mind.","shortExplanation":"When someone says a headphone is <b>fatiguing</b>, they mean that it's not comfortable to listen to for long periods because something about the sound wears you down.<br><br>A common cause is <i>too much treble or upper midrange energy</i>, which can make music sound piercing or aggressive to the ear. After a short while, you might feel the urge to lower the volume, take off the headphones, or you might get a slight headache or ear strain.<br><br>Fatigue can also come from a booming bass that physically overwhelms, or just a general loudness and distortion that irritates. In contrast, <i>non-fatiguing</i> (or \"easy listening\") sound signatures are smooth, balanced, or warm – they let you listen for hours without discomfort. The term <i>listening fatigue</i> is often used in audio to describe this phenomenon.","detailedDescription":"Listener fatigue is a real and subjective effect. Technically, our ears are most sensitive to the 2–5 kHz range (roughly where human voices project and where many harsh sounds lie).<br><br>If a headphone overemphasizes these frequencies (<i>think of a very bright or shouty headphone</i>), it can cause quicker fatigue because our auditory system becomes stressed by the prolonged exposure to what it perceives as loud or sharp sounds. Even if it doesn't outright hurt, it's tiring – similar to how staring at a bright light can strain your eyes.<br><br>Fatiguing sound can manifest as a burning sensation in the ear, a headache, or just a feeling of <i>\"I need to turn this off for a bit.\"</i> Some Beyerdynamic and Grado models, for instance, are famous for their detail and brightness but are also cited as fatiguing by some listeners if used for too long at higher volumes.<br><br>It's not solely about treble either. <i>Loud volume</i> is fatiguing in general (regardless of tonal balance, high SPL will tire out ears). <i>Distortion</i> is another factor: if a headphone or amp is producing distortion, the subtle abrasive sound can cause fatigue. A very <i>forward/aggressive presentation</i> (where nothing in the music gives you a break) can also be mentally fatiguing.<br><br>Newcomers should understand that a headphone sounding impressive in a short demo (with a vivid, bright, super-detailed sound) might not be the one you want to use all day. This is why many seasoned audiophiles gravitate towards <i>balanced or slightly warm headphones for daily listening</i>, as they are easier on the ears. Conversely, for short, critical sessions, one might use the super-detailed but fatiguing set. It's about usage and preference.<br><br>There is occasionally debate around <i>what is fatiguing</i> because tolerance varies. One person might find a certain treble level intolerable while another is fine. Some adapt over time as well. But universally, <b>smooth = less fatiguing</b> and <b>harsh = more fatiguing</b>.<br><br>Terms like <b>\"non-fatiguing,\" \"easy on the ears,\" or \"forgiving\"</b> are used to describe gear that one can listen to indefinitely without feeling worn out.<br><br>In summary, calling a headphone <i>fatiguing</i> is a warning sign: it might do some things well (often it correlates with very <i>revealing</i> or <i>bright</i> gear), but you may not be able to relax with it. As a newcomer, pay attention to this descriptor – if you see many users saying a headphone is fatiguing and you know you dislike sharp highs, it's probably not the best choice for marathon listening sessions. Everyone has a different fatigue threshold, so it's a personal comfort metric in addition to pure sound quality.","relatedTerms":["Harsh","Sibilant","Bright","Aggressive"],"oppositeTerms":["Smooth","Easy-listening","Forgiving","Non-fatiguing"],"tags":["tiring","harsh","uncomfortable","strain"],"technicalRange":"2-5kHz peak"};
