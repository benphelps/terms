Imagine a subwoofer in a small box – each bass hit doesn't stop cleanly but resonates, causing a lingering <b>\"bwoom\"</b> sound.<br><br>In headphones, a boomy bass often manifests as a bloated, uncontrolled low end: kick drums and bass guitars tend to blur together, and you might feel a constant bass presence even when the song calls for silence between the beats.<br><br>This is <b>not</b> the same as having good deep bass extension or impact; rather, it's a lack of control. Technically, boomy sound often has <b>excessive mid-bass amplitude</b> and not enough damping to quell the vibrations.<br><br>The effect on music is that vocals and instruments lose some clarity, since the booming bass masks nuances (this is related to the concept of <i>masking</i>, where loud low frequencies make it hard to hear mids/highs).<br><br>Community discussions sometimes point out that certain closed-back or bass-heavy consumer headphones (or poorly tuned IEMs) exhibit boominess. The opposite of <i>boomy</i> is <b>\"tight\"</b> or <b>\"clean\"</b> bass, where low frequencies are present but do not spill over.<br><br>While bass lovers (self-described <i>bassheads</i>) do enjoy elevated bass, they typically seek <b>impact and depth without boominess</b> – i.e., powerful yet controlled bass. Therefore, <i>boomy</i> is usually a criticism.<br><br>In EQ terms, reducing the 100–200 Hz region can often tame boominess. In summary, calling a headphone <i>boomy</i> implies it has an unrefined, overdone bass that needs tightening up for a more balanced sound.","relatedTerms":["Muddy","Loose","Slow"],"oppositeTerms":["Tight","Clean","Fast","Controlled"],"tags":["excessive","resonant","uncontrolled","mid-bass"],"technicalRange":"100-200Hz"};
